              <p>Had a really hard time searching for this random actor I found in a Geico commercial. Spent several
                hours looking for his name or even the commercial, but no luck. Uploaded a screenshot and knew his name
                within seconds really didn‚Äôt expect this app to work and it performed perfectly 10 out of 10 would
                recommend.!!</p>

              <p>Extremely accurate! It was bugging me that I couldn't figure out who this actor was that showed up
                briefly in a series. I recognised him, but couldn't place where from. I tried searching the entire
                series cast and found nothing. Found this app and honestly didn't expect much, so super pleased when it
                found the actor immediately! üòéüëäüèª It showed me exactly what he's been in, things Google didn't even
                bring up upon a name search üí™üèª Definitely recommend this app ü§©</p>

              <p>I wanted to find out who an actress was in a program that I was watching and her name wasn't in the
                credits. l found this app to try out and it works perfectly, I just paused the program, took a picture
                and then used the app. It took about five seconds to find the actress. I would give this app twenty
                stars as it's the best app I've ever used.</p>

              <p>At first it did not work because the picture of the person of interest had their eyes closed, but after
                taking a better non-blurry picture with the eyes open it worked. Great app!!</p>

              <p>fantastic! I have never wrote a review in my life but I'm so pleasantly surprised by this app I'm going out of my way to. downloaded it because I couldnt placed a small time actress and had almost 0 faith it would work but it did brilliantly. this will be my new go to instead of scrolling through imdb to place actors!</p>

              <p>Just downloaded this because an actor was shown in the crowd of a comedy central roast and I couldn't
                for the life of me recall what I saw him in... Uploaded a blurry shot of my TV, not expecting much, but
                not only did it save me from wracking my brain on that actor, it also gave me 2/4 blurred out celebs in
                the background too!</p>

          <h4>2. General information and mandatory information</h4>
          Data protection ‚Äã The operators of this website take the protection of your personal data very seriously. We
          treat your personal
          data as confidential and in accordance with the statutory data protection regulations and this privacy policy.
          ‚Äã If you use this website, various pieces of personal data will be collected. Personal information is any data
          with which you could be personally identified. This privacy policy explains what information we collect and
          what
          we use it for. It also explains how and for what purpose this happens. ‚Äã Please note that data transmitted via
          the internet (e.g. via email communication) may be subject to security breaches. Complete protection of your
          data from third-party access is not possible. ‚Äã ‚Äã Revocation of your consent to the processing of your data ‚Äã
          Many data processing operations are only possible with your express consent. You may revoke your consent at
          any
          time with future effect. An informal email making this request is sufficient. The data processed before we
          receive
          your request may still be legally processed. ‚Äã ‚Äã Right to file complaints with regulatory authorities ‚Äã If
          there
          has been a breach of data protection legislation, the person affected may file a complaint with the competent
          regulatory authorities. The competent regulatory authority for matters related to data protection legislation
          is the data protection officer of the German state in which our company is headquartered. A list of data
          protection
          officers and their contact details can be found at the following link:
          https://www.bfdi.bund.de/DE/Infothek/Anschriften_Links/anschriften_links-node.html.
          ‚Äã ‚Äã Right to data portability ‚Äã You have the right to have data which we process based on your consent or in
          fulfillment of a contract automatically delivered to yourself or to a third party in a standard,
          machine-readable
          format. If you require the direct transfer of data to another responsible party, this will only be done to the
          extent technically feasible. ‚Äã ‚Äã Information, blocking, deletion ‚Äã As permitted by law, you have the right to
          be provided at any time with information free of charge about any of your personal data that is stored as well
          as its origin, the recipient and the purpose for which it has been processed. You also have the right to have
          this data corrected, blocked or deleted. You can contact us at any time using the address given in our legal
          notice if you have further questions on the topic of personal data. ‚Äã ‚Äã Opposition to promotional emails ‚Äã We
          hereby expressly prohibit the use of contact data published in the context of website legal notice
          requirements
          with regard to sending promotional and informational materials not expressly requested. The website operator
          reserves the right to take specific legal action if unsolicited advertising material, such as email spam, is
          received. ‚Äã

          <h4>3. Data collection on our website</h4> ‚Äã Cookies ‚Äã Some of our web pages use cookies. Cookies do not harm
          your computer and do not contain any viruses. Cookies help make our website more user-friendly, efficient, and
          secure. Cookies are small text files that are stored on your computer and saved by your browser. ‚Äã Most of the
          cookies we use are so-called "session cookies." They are automatically deleted after your visit. Other cookies
          remain in your device's memory until you delete them. These cookies make it possible to recognize your browser
          when you next visit the site. ‚Äã You can configure your browser to inform you about the use of cookies so that
          you can decide on a case-by-case basis whether to accept or reject a cookie. Alternatively, your browser can
          be configured to automatically accept cookies under certain conditions or to always reject them, or to

          Cookies
          which are necessary to allow electronic communications or to provide certain functions you wish to use (such
          as the shopping cart) are stored pursuant to Art. 6 paragraph 1, letter f of DSGVO. The website operator has
          a legitimate interest in the storage of cookies to ensure an optimized service provided free of technical

          If other cookies (such as those used to analyze your surfing behavior) are also stored, they will be treated
          separately in this privacy policy. Server log files ‚Äã The website provider automatically collects and stores

          and browser version ¬∑ Operating system used ¬∑ Referrer URL ¬∑ Host name of the accessing computer ¬∑ Time of the
          server request ¬∑ IP address ‚Äã These data will not be combined with data from other sources. The basis for data
          processing is Art. 6 (1) (f) DSGVO, which allows the processing of data to fulfill a contract or for measures
          preliminary to a contract.

          <h4>4. Analytics and advertising</h4>
          Google Analytics ‚Äã This website uses Google Analytics, a web analytics service. It is operated by Google Inc.,
          1600 Amphitheatre
          Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA. Google Analytics uses so-called "cookies". These are text files that
          are
          stored on your computer and that allow an analysis of the use of the website by you. The information generated
          by the cookie about your use of this website is usually transmitted to a Google server in the USA and stored
          there. Google Analytics cookies are stored based on Art. 6 (1) (f) DSGVO. The website operator has a
          legitimate
          interest in analyzing user behavior to optimize both its website and its advertising. ‚Äã ‚Äã Browser plugin ‚Äã You
          can prevent these cookies being stored by selecting the appropriate settings in your browser. However, we wish
          to point out that doing so may mean you will not be able to enjoy the full functionality of this website. You
          can also prevent the data generated by cookies about your use of the website (incl. your IP address) from
          being
          passed to Google, and the processing of these data by Google, by downloading and installing the browser plugin
          available at the following link: https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en. Objecting to the collection
          of data ‚Äã You can prevent the collection of your data by Google Analytics by clicking on the following link.
          An opt-out cookie will be set to prevent your data from being collected on future visits to this site: Disable

          policy:
          https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/6004245?hl=en. Demographic data collection by Google Analytics ‚Äã
          This website uses Google Analytics' demographic features. This allows reports to be generated containing
          statements
          about the age, gender, and interests of site visitors. This data comes from interest-based advertising from
          Google
          and third-party visitor data. This collected data cannot be attributed to any specific individual person. You
          can disable this feature at any time by adjusting the ads settings in your Google account or you can forbid
          the
          collection of your data by Google Analytics as described in the section "Refusal of data collection". ‚Äã ‚Äã
          Google
          AdWords and Google Conversion Tracking ‚Äã This website uses Google AdWords. AdWords is an online advertising
          program
          from Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheater Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, United States ("Google"). As part of
          Google
          AdWords, we use so-called conversion tracking. When you click on an ad served by Google, a conversion tracking
          cookie is set. Cookies are small text files that your internet browser stores on your computer. These cookies
          expire after 30 days and are not used for personal identification of the user. Should the user visit certain
          pages of the website and the cookie has not yet expired, Google and the website can tell that the user clicked
          on the ad and proceeded to that page. Each Google AdWords advertiser has a different cookie. Thus, cookies
          cannot
          be tracked using the website of an AdWords advertiser. The information obtained using the conversion cookie is
          used to create conversion statistics for the AdWords advertisers who have opted for conversion tracking.

          are told the total number of users who clicked on their ad and were redirected to a conversion tracking tag
          page.
          However, advertisers do not obtain any information that can be used to personally identify users. If you do
          not
          want to participate in tracking, you can opt-out of this by easily disabling the Google Conversion Tracking
          cookie
          by changing your browser settings. In doing so, you will not be included in the conversion tracking
          statistics.
          Conversion cookies are stored based on Art. 6 (1) (f) DSGVO. The website operator has a legitimate interest in
          analyzing user behavior to optimize both its website and its advertising. For more information about Google
